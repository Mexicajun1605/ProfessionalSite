Hello everyone, 

My name is Samuel Johnson and I am a Linguist, Data Analyst, and a Spanish Instructor. I earned my degree in Hispanic Linguistics while studying at New Mexico State University and am currently working as a Data Analyst for La Clinica de Familia in Las Cruces, NM. 

I am dedicated to understanding the systems behind how things work and using those systems to create. This is why I am so passionate about Linguistics and Data. This dedication is driving me towards my current goals of one day having a Ph.D, acquiring the title of Statistician or Data Scientist, and to make the world better with my skills. 

Furthermore, I am dedicated to teaching the skills that I learn and use in accordance with the third goal. On this site you will be able to find projects that you can use to learn more about Language and Data as well as a link to my Youtube Channel where you can follow me on my own language learning Journey and learn other skills such as programming and how to learn languages. 

Salve et Gratias tibi ago pro hoc legere,
