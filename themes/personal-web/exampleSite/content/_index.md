Salve, hola, bonjour, tudo bem, wie gehts et annyeong, 

My name is Sam Johnson. I am a linguist with an M.A. in Hispanic linguistics and I am currently working as a Data Analyst. 

I love things that work systematically and can be used to understand the world and create, hence my love for technology and most of all language. Some of my future goals include a Ph.D. furthering my skills in Machine Learning/AI and Natural Language Processing and contributing more to open source software.

Since I am not in Academia, I plan on continuing my teaching work through podcasts and Youtube, so stay tuned for updates on lessons in Spanish, Linguistics, Programming, Research, and my personal language learning journeys. 

Also please check this site out to see a variety of projects that I have worked on.

I speak the following languages
English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, and Latin
